## Part-A

1.  ### a) What is an HTML element? Give example.
      An HTML Element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag, which together define the elementâ€™s structure and functionality. Elements are the basic building blocks of a webpage and can represent different types of content, such as text, links, images, or headings. [[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-elements/)]

      ```HTML
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      
      <head>
          <title>Exam Dawn</title>
      </head>
      
      <body>
          <p>Hello World!</p>
      </body>
      
      </html>
      ```

    ### b) What do you mean by Boxing/Unboxing?
      - **Boxing**:
         - The process of converting a Value Type variable (char, int etc.) to a Reference Type variable (object).
         - Boxing is an implicit conversion process in which object type (super type) is used.
         - Reference type variables (which are essentially references) are stored on the stack, while the actual data they point to is stored on the heap.
      - **Unboxing**:
         - The process of converting a Reference Type variable into a Value Type variable is known as Unboxing.
         - It is an explicit conversion process. [[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-boxing-unboxing/)]

    ### c) List any four operators which cannot be overloaded.
      - **Member Access Operator**: Used to access members of a class or structure.
      - **Type Casting Operator**: Used for explicit type conversion.
      - **Sizeof Operator**: Used to obtain the size of a type in bytes.
      - **Throw Operator**: Used to throw exceptions. [[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-operator-overloading/)]

    ### d) What is the significance of component tray?
      The component tray is a rectangular region displayed at the bottom of the design view window while in design view mode, once it is active. The component tray becomes active in design view after a component that is displayed in the component tray has been added to or is part of the current document. The significance of the Component Tray:
      - Event Handling
      - Ease of Use 
      - Visibility Control
      - Resource Management [[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.design.componenttray?view=windowsdesktop-9.0)]

    ### e) Differentiate between TextBox and Label controls.
      | Feature                | TextBox                                      | Label                                      |
      |------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
      | **Purpose**            | Used for user input; allows text entry.     | Used to display static text or information.|
      | **User  Interaction**   | Editable by the user; can accept input.     | Non-editable; users cannot modify the text.|
      | **Text Property**      | Can be changed at runtime based on user input. | Typically set at design time and remains constant.|
      | **Appearance**         | Can have different styles (multiline, password, etc.). | Simple text display; can be styled but not for input.|
      | **Events**             | Supports events like `TextChanged`, `KeyPress`, etc. | Supports events like `Click`, but not for text input.|
      | **Focus**              | Can receive focus and is part of the tab order. | Cannot receive focus; not part of the tab order.|
      | **Use Case**           | Ideal for forms where user input is required (e.g., entering names, passwords). | Ideal for displaying labels, instructions, or titles without user interaction. |

    ### f) Write the purpose of Dim and Redim keywords.
      - **Dim**: The Visual Basic compiler uses the Dim statement to determine the variable's data type and other information, such as what code can access the variable. The following example declares a variable to hold an Integer value. [[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement)]
      EXAMPLE: 
         ```VB
         Dim variable_name As Integer
         ```
      - **ReDim**: The ReDim statement is used to size or resize a dynamic array that has already been formally declared by using a Private, Public, or Dim statement with empty parentheses (without dimension subscripts). [[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/redim-statement)] 
      EXAMPLE:
         ```VB
         ReDim X(10, 10, 10) 
         . . . 
         ReDim Preserve X(10, 10, 15)
         ```

    ### g) What is FormView control? List any two properties.
      The FormView control is used to display a single record at a time from a data source. When you use the FormView control, you create templates to display and edit data-bound values. The templates contain controls, binding expressions, and formatting that define the look and functionality of the form. The Two properties are:
      - Background
      - Class Reference 

    ### h) What is Simple Binding?
      The ability of a control to bind to a single data element, such as a value in a column in a dataset table. This is the type of binding typical for controls such as a TextBox control or Label control, which are controls that typically only displays a single value.
